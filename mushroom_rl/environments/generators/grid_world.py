    This Grid World generator requires a .txt file to specify the
    shape of the grid world and the cells. There are five types of cells: 'S' is
    the starting position where the agent is; 'G' is the goal state; '.' is a
    normal cell; '*' is a hole, when the agent steps on a hole, it receives a
    negative reward and the episode ends; '#' is a wall, when the agent is
    supposed to step on a wall, it actually remains in its current state. The
    initial states distribution is uniform among all the initial states
    provided.

    The grid is expected to be rectangular.

        grid (str): the path of the file containing the grid structure;
