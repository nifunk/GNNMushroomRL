    """
    This Taxi generator requires a .txt file to specify the shape of the grid
    world and the cells. There are five types of cells: 'S' is the starting
    where the agent is; 'G' is the goal state; '.' is a normal cell; 'F' is a
    passenger, when the agent steps on a hole, it picks up it.
    '#' is a wall, when the agent is supposed to step on a wall, it actually
    remains in its current state. The initial states distribution is uniform
    among all the initial states provided. The episode terminates when the agent
    reaches the goal state. The reward is always 0, except for the goal state
    where it depends on the number of collected passengers. Each action has
    a certain probability of success and, if it fails, the agent goes in a
    perpendicular direction from the supposed one.

    The grid is expected to be rectangular.

    This problem is inspired from:
    "Bayesian Q-Learning". Dearden R. et al.. 1998.

    Args:
        grid (str): the path of the file containing the grid structure;

        gamma (float, .99): discount factor;
        horizon (int, np.inf): the horizon.

    Returns:
        A FiniteMDP object built with the provided parameters.
